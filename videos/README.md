# Project Demo Videos

This folder contains demonstration videos of our Indoor Navigation project.

- **Video 1 – Guidance Replay (Offline)**  
  This video shows the replay of a recorded trajectory with a selected goal.  
  The path is visualized, and guidance is simulated step by step until the goal is reached.  
  (Generated by `guidance_offline.py`.)

- **Video 2 – Live Guidance (Terminal Output)**  
  This video shows the live system in action.  
  ORB-SLAM3 runs on the dataset, and at the same time the guidance script reads the live camera poses.  
  The terminal prints instructions like “turn left/right” and “forward” until ✅ *goal reached*.
